%This toolbox allows the modelling and simulation of static and dynamic
%Run this file to initialize the Rigid-Soft Robotics Toolbox
%Last modified by Anup Teejo Mathew - 18/01/2022

%% Basic operation instructions:
%You can start using this toolbox by defining links, in order to create a link
%define a variable as shown below:

% LinkName = SorosimLink

%You will then have to answer questions in the form of dialougue boxes
%In order to define the link's gemetric and material properties.

%After your link is created you can create a linkage which connects any
%links you've created previously. A linkage is a chain of 1 or more links.
%Syntax for creating a Linkage is given below:

% LinkageName = SorosimLinkage(LinkName1,LinkName2.....LinkNameN)

%Dialougue boxes will then be used to collect input that is used to define
%the linkage properties. You can access any link or linkage properties by calling the property name
%as shown below:

% LinkName.LinkPropertyName
% LinkageName.LinkagePropertyName

%Similarly methods can also be used to evaluate properties outside of the 
%classconstructor after the object is created 

%LinkageName.MethodName(Input1...InputN)

%You can run a static simulation by using the below command:
 
% LinkageName.statics
%The static simulation's output is a vector of joint angles

%A dynamic simulation can be performed using:

%LinkageName.dynamics
%The two outputs of a dynamic simulation are the time vector (t) and a
%matrix containing the configuration (q) and velocity (qd) at every time 
%element of (t). It is a good practice to save the outputs of the dynamic
%simulation for easy access.

%The examples folder of the toolbox contains some saved Linkages and Links
%you can run simulations for
